# simplePyAvroPhonetic
This is a shameless low effort copy of the PyAvroPhonic Library. The existing one causes many problems for windows and python 3,
so I stripped off all the embellishments and put everything into one file, avro.py. You just need to import avro and parse any Takla sentence that you want.
Will bring some modifications to this later on. This is the first step towards something big, I hope.


How to Run:
import avro
avro.parse('ami bhalo achi')
